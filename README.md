The Artificial Intelligence Dietician is a bot with artificial intelligence about human diets. It acts as a diet consultant similar to a real dietician. Dieticians are eduated with food nutrient values. A dietician consults a person based on his schedule, body type, height and weight. The system too asks the data mentioned from the user like how many hours the user works, his height, weight, age, etc. and processes it. It then calculates the nutrient value needed to satisfy user needs. Based on the rules defined, the system shows an appropriate diet to the users and asks for affirmation regarding the same. In case the user is not satisfied, an alternate diet is provided for satisfying usersâ€™ needs.
