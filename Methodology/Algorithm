Methodology/Algorithm Used


For the proposed project, a series of steps were followed for the system to recommend a diet plan.
Step 1:
 Clean and prepare the data as per the requirements
Step 2:
 Input details from the user: Age (in years), Weight (in pounds), Height (in Feet and Inches) and daily exercise level.
Step 3: 
Calculate Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) using the Harris-Benedict Equations: Men BMR= 88.362 + (13.397 * weight in kg) + (4.799 * height in cm) – (5.677 * age in years) Women BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 * weight in kg) + (3.099 * height in cm) – (4.330 * age in years)
Step 4: 
Calculate the calorie intake using the following table:
Exercise level Daily Calories Required (Kcal/day) Little to no exercise Daily kilocalories needed = BMR x 1.2 Light exercise (1–3 days per week) Daily kilocalories needed = BMR x 1.375 Moderate exercise (3–5 days per week) Daily kilocalories needed = BMR x 1.55 Heavy exercise (6–7 days per week) Daily kilocalories needed = BMR x 1.725 Very heavy exercise (twice per day, extra heavy workouts) Daily kilocalories needed = BMR x 1.9
Step 5:
 Then we use randint(0,6) function to select items from list
Step 6: 
Recommend a diet plan based on the above steps. If not interested, look for an alternative plan using the defined rules by clicking on submit.
